    "### 1. What is a Database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to manage and manipulate data efficiently. In a database, data is organized into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field or attribute. For example, consider a university database where there are tables for students, courses, and grades. The students' table might have columns like student ID, name, and date of birth.\n",

    "###  2. Write a short note on File base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Integrity:** Databases enforce rules to maintain data accuracy and consistency.\n",
    "   - **Data Security:** Access control and permissions protect sensitive information.\n",
    "   - **Efficient Retrieval:** Databases provide fast and efficient ways to retrieve and query data.\n",
    "   - **Concurrency Control:** Ensures multiple users can access and modify data simultaneously without conflicts.\n",
    "   - **Data Relationships:** Databases allow the establishment of relationships between different sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?\n",
    "\n",
    "   File-based storage systems involve storing data in files, often in a hierarchical or tree-like structure. Each department or user maintains its own set of files. Major challenges of a file-based system include:\n",
    "   - **Data Redundancy:** Same data may be duplicated in multiple files, leading to redundancy.\n",
    "   - **Data Inconsistency:** Updates in one file may not reflect in others, causing inconsistency.\n",
    "   - **Limited Data Sharing:** Difficulty in sharing data across different departments or users.\n",
    "   - **Data Dependence:** Programs are highly dependent on the file structure, making it inflexible.\n",
    "   - **Security Issues:** Limited access control and security measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DEMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A DBMS is software that provides an interface to interact with databases. It facilitates the creation, maintenance, and manipulation of databases. The need for DBMS arises due to:\n",
    "   - **Data Independence:** Separates the database structure from the application programs.\n",
    "   - **Data Integrity:** Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data.\n",
    "   - **Concurrent Access:** Allows multiple users to access and modify data simultaneously.\n",
    "   - **Data Security:** Provides access control and authentication measures.\n",
    "   - **Data Abstraction:** Presents a simplified view of the data to the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Redundancy:** DBMS minimizes redundancy through normalization.\n",
    "   - **Data Inconsistency:** DBMS enforces integrity constraints to ensure consistency.\n",
    "   - **Limited Data Sharing:** DBMS provides a centralized repository for shared data.\n",
    "   - **Data Dependence:** DBMS allows changes in the database structure without affecting programs.\n",
    "   - **Security Issues:** DBMS enhances security through access controls and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the significance of Data Modelling and explain the types of data modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Based on Data Model:**\n",
    "     - *Relational DBMS (RDBMS):* Organizes data into tables with relationships.\n",
    "     - *NoSQL DBMS:* Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - **Based on Number of Users:**\n",
    "     - *Single-user DBMS:* Designed for a single user.\n",
    "     - *Multi-user DBMS:* Supports multiple users concurrently.\n",
    "   - **Based on Data Access Method:**\n",
    "     - *Centralized DBMS:* Data is stored at a central location.\n",
    "     - *Distributed DBMS:* Data is distributed across different locations.\n",
    "   - **Based on Database Structure:**\n",
    "     - *Hierarchical DBMS:* Organizes data in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "     - *Network DBMS:* Utilizes a network-like data model.\n",
    "     \n",
    "### 7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.\n",
    "   - **Significance:**\n",
    "     - *Simplifies Complexity:* Represents complex systems in a structured manner.\n",
    "     - *Communication:* Provides a common language for communication between stakeholders.\n",
    "     - *Blueprint for Database:* Serves as a blueprint for designing the database.\n",
    "   - **Types:**\n",
    "     - *Conceptual Data Model:* Abstract representation of entities and their relationships.\n",
    "     - *Logical Data Model:* Describes data in terms of tables, relationships, and constraints.\n",
    "     - *Physical Data Model:* Specifies how data will be stored, accessed, and implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Three Schema Architecture and Advantages:**\n",
    "   - **Three Schema Architecture:**\n",
    "     - *User Schema (View):* Describes how users perceive the data.\n",
    "     - *Logical Schema (Conceptual):* Represents the logical structure of the entire database.\n",
    "     - *Physical Schema:* Defines how the data is physically stored and accessed.\n",
    "   - **Advantages:**\n",
    "     - *Data Independence:* Changes in one schema do not affect others, providing abstraction layers.\n",
    "     - *Security:* Access to sensitive data can be controlled at the schema level.\n",
    "     - *Flexibility:* Modifications to the database structure can be made without affecting user views."
