    "**Pseudo-Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"pseudo-class\" in CSS refers to a keyword that is used to define a special state of an HTML element.<br>\n",
    "The prefix \"pseudo-\" indicates that these classes are not real or directly selectable classes in the HTML document.<br>  Instead, they represent a specific state or condition of an element, such as :hover for the hover state, :active for the active state, or :first-child for the first child of a parent element.<br>\n",
    "The term \"pseudo\" is used to distinguish these classes from real classes defined in the HTML markup.\n",

    "**Gradients in CSS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Gradients in CSS are a way to smoothly transition between two or more colors.<br>\n",
    "  CSS gradients allow you to create a blend of colors that can be applied to backgrounds, borders, or even text. \n",
    "\n",
    "  *There are two main types of gradients in CSS:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Gradients:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These gradients transition colors in a straight line, either horizontally, vertically, or at any angle specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a horizontal linear gradient and radial gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* Example of a horizontal linear gradient */\n",
    "background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Example of a radial gradient */\n",
    "background: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow);\n",
    "``` \n",

    "### 3. What are different types of transitions in Css? ###\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions in CSS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitions in CSS allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration. They are often used to create smooth animations or effects when an element undergoes a change in state. Commonly used properties for transitions include transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.<br> Here are some types of transitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Color Transitions:**\n",
