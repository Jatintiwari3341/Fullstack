    "### 1. What are media queries in CSS and their use case?\n",
    "\n".
         "  Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow you to apply styles based on various characteristics of the user's device or browser. They enable you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities. Media queries are commonly used in conjunction with the `@media` rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of a media query for a specific screen width:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n",
    "       /* Styles applied only when the screen width is 600 pixels or less */\n",
    "       body {\n",
    "           background-color: lightblue;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 2. Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **min-width:** Specifies a minimum width at which the styles within the media query will apply. If the viewport width is equal to or greater than the specified value, the styles will be applied.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n",
    "         /* Styles applied when the screen width is 768 pixels or more */\n",
    "         body {\n",
    "             font-size: 16px;\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **max-width:** Specifies a maximum width at which the styles within the media query will apply. If the viewport width is equal to or less than the specified value, the styles will be applied.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     @media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {\n",
    "         /* Styles applied when the screen width is 1200 pixels or less */\n",
    "         body {\n",
    "             font-size: 14px;\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   By using both `min-width` and `max-width` in media queries, you can create responsive designs that adapt to a range of screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Explain float property and clear property in CSS with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Float Property:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     The `float` property is used to specify whether an element should be placed to the left or right of its container, allowing other elements to wrap around it. Commonly used for creating layouts where elements float next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     .float-example {\n",
    "         float: left;\n",
    "         width: 50%;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Clear Property:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     The `clear` property is used to control the behavior of an element concerning floating elements. It specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     .clear-example {\n",
    "         clear: both; /* Prevents elements from floating on both sides */\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     In this example, the element with the class `clear-example` will be placed below any floating elements, ensuring that it doesn't wrap around them. The `clear` property can take values like `left`, `right`, and `both` to control the clearing behavior on specific sides."
