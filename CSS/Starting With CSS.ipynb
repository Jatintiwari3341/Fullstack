    "### 1. What is CSS and why use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Definition:** CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It enables the separation of document content (HTML or XML) from document presentation (style and layout). CSS allows web developers to control the appearance of multiple pages consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Why Use CSS:**\n",
    "     - **Separation of Concerns:** CSS separates the structure and content of a webpage from its visual presentation. This makes the code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "     - **Consistency:** CSS enables the consistent styling of multiple pages. Changes made in the style sheet are reflected across all associated pages.\n",
    "     - **Reuse:** Styles can be reused across different elements and pages, reducing redundancy in the code.\n",
    "     - **Responsive Design:** CSS plays a crucial role in creating responsive and adaptive designs for various screen sizes and devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file?\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Inline CSS:** This involves placing the CSS directly within the HTML file, using the `style` attribute in HTML tags. For example:\n",
    "     ```html\n",
    "     <p style=\"color: red;\">This is a red paragraph.</p>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Internal/Embedded CSS:** CSS is placed within the `<style>` element in the HTML document's `<head>` section. For example:\n",
    "     ```html\n",
    "     <head>\n",
    "       <style>\n",
    "         p {\n",
    "           color: blue;\n",
    "         }\n",
    "       </style>\n",
    "     </head>\n",
    "     <body>\n",
    "       <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p>\n",
    "     </body>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **External CSS:** CSS code is stored in a separate external file with a `.css` extension. This file is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. For example:\n",
    "     ```html\n",
    "     <head>\n",
    "       <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n",
    "     </head>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Importing CSS:** CSS files can be imported into another CSS file using the `@import` rule. For example:\n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     /* main.css */\n",
    "     @import url(\"styles.css\");\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 . What do you mean by specificity in CSS?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS style rule is applied to an element. It is used to resolve conflicts when multiple style rules target the same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Specificity Hierarchy:**\n",
    "     - **Inline Styles:** Have the highest specificity.\n",
    "     - **ID Selectors:** Have a higher specificity than class selectors and tag selectors.\n",
    "     - **Class Selectors and Attribute Selectors:** Have a higher specificity than tag selectors.\n",
    "     - **Tag Selectors:** Have the lowest specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Calculating Specificity:**\n",
    "     - Specificity is often represented as a four-part value, such as `0,1,0,0` (representing the counts of inline styles, ID selectors, class selectors, and tag selectors, respectively).\n",
    "     - The higher the specificity value, the more precedence a rule has.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```css\n",
    "     /* Specificity: 0,0,1,0 */\n",
    "     p {\n",
    "       color: blue;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     /* Specificity: 0,1,0,0 */\n",
    "     #special-paragraph {\n",
    "       color: red;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     /* Specificity: 1,0,0,0 */\n",
    "     inline {\n",
    "       color: green;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     In this example, the inline style will take precedence over the ID selector, and the ID selector will take precedence over the tag selector."
