    "### 1. Why do we start learning a programming language with \"Hello, World!\"?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Starting with a \"Hello, World!\" program is a tradition in programming and serves several purposes:\n",
    "   - It's a simple introduction to the syntax and structure of a programming language.\n",
    "   - It ensures that your development environment is set up correctly.\n",
    "   - It provides immediate feedback, helping you understand how to write, run, and debug code.\n",
    "   - It establishes a foundation for building more complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The simplicity of printing \"Hello, World!\" allows beginners to focus on the basics of writing and executing code without getting overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Comments in programming serve to provide explanations, notes, or context within the code. They are not executed and are meant for human readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In HTML, comments are written using the `<!-- ... -->` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <!-- This is a comment in HTML -->\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Comments can be used to describe the purpose of certain code, make notes to yourself or other developers, or temporarily disable parts of the code during testing or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are elements, tags, and attributes, and the difference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Element:** In HTML, an element is a fundamental building block that defines the structure of a document. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag, and `</p>` is the closing tag of a paragraph element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Tag:** Tags are used to define HTML elements. They consist of a tag name enclosed in angle brackets. Tags come in pairs, with an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Attribute:** Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag. They are made up of a name and a value. For example, in `<a href=\"https://example.com\">`, `href` is the attribute name, and `\"https://example.com\"` is the attribute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Difference:**\n",
    "   - An element is the entire entity, including both the opening and closing tags along with the content.\n",
    "   - A tag is just the opening or closing part of an element.\n",
    "   - An attribute is extra information included in the opening tag to provide additional details about the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Briefly explain what HTML entities are.\n",
    "\n",
    "   HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They are particularly useful when you want to display reserved characters (like `<`, `>`, `&`) or characters with special meanings (like © or €) in your HTML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - `&lt;` represents `<`\n",
    "   - `&gt;` represents `>`\n",
    "   - `&amp;` represents `&`\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using HTML entities ensures that browsers correctly interpret and display characters without interfering with the HTML structure."
