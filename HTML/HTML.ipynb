<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"><b>HTML</b></h1>
</div>

### 1. What are inline and block elements in HTML, and what's the difference between them?

In HTML, elements are classified into two main categories: inline and block elements.

- **Inline Elements:**
  - Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.
  - These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
  - Inline elements allow other elements to sit beside them.

- **Block Elements:**
  - Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`.
  - These elements start on a new line and take up the full width available.
  - Block elements create a "block" or a "box" in the layout, typically stacking vertically.

### 2. How to work with images in HTML, and explain the importance of the `<img/>` tag in various scenarios?

To work with images in HTML, you use the `<img>` tag.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">
```

- **Attributes:**
  - `src`: Specifies the path to the image file.
  - `alt`: Provides alternative text for screen readers and in case the image cannot be loaded.
  - `width` and `height`: Optional attributes to set the dimensions of the image.

**Importance:**
- Images are essential for enhancing the visual appeal of web pages.
- `<img>` tag is crucial for embedding images, illustrations, and other visual content.
- It's important to use meaningful alt text for accessibility and SEO purposes.

### 3. How to create lists in HTML?

In HTML, you can create ordered lists (`<ol>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`).

- **Ordered List:**
  ```html
  <ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
  </ol>
  ```

- **Unordered List:**
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
  ```

- **Definition List:**
  ```html
  <dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd>Definition 1</dd>
    <dt>Term 2</dt>
    <dd>Definition 2</dd>
  </dl>
  ```

### 4. How to hyperlink web pages and navigate people to other websites?

To create hyperlinks in HTML, you use the `<a>` (anchor) tag.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

- The `href` attribute contains the URL to which the link points.
- You can use relative paths for internal links within the same website.

```html
<a href="/page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
```

- To open the link in a new tab or window, you can use the `target="_blank"` attribute.

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
```
