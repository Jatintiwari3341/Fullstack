    "### 1. What are the new things introduced in HTML5?\n",
    "\n",
    " **Semantic Elements:** HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that provide a clearer structure for web documents, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the content. Examples include `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>`.\n",
    "   - **Audio and Video:** HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.\n",
    "   - **Canvas:** The `<canvas>` element allows dynamic rendering of graphics and images directly in the browser, enabling the creation of interactive games and visualizations.\n",
    "   - **New Form Input Types:** HTML5 introduced new input types like `email`, `url`, `tel`, `number`, `date`, etc., making it easier to validate and process user input.\n",
    "   - **Local Storage:** The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs provide a way to store data locally on the user's device, improving web application performance.\n",
    "   - **WebSockets:** HTML5 introduced the WebSockets API, enabling bidirectional communication between the browser and the server, facilitating real-time applications.\n",
    "   - **Responsive Design:** HTML5 introduced features like the `<meta>` tag for viewport settings and media queries, making it easier to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.\n",
    "   - **Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning about the structure and content of the document.**\n",
    "   - Examples include:\n",
    "     - `<header>`: Represents the header of a section or page.\n",
    "     - `<nav>`: Defines a navigation menu.\n",
    "     - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content, like a news article or blog post.\n",
    "     - `<section>`: Represents a generic section of a document.\n",
    "     - `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, often used for sidebars.\n",
    "     - `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a section or page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. List some uses of semantic tags.\n",
    "   - **Improved Document Structure:** Semantic tags enhance the clarity and structure of HTML documents, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain code.\n",
    "   - **Accessibility:** Semantic tags contribute to improved accessibility for users with disabilities, as screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the structure of the content.\n",
    "   - **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Search engines can better understand the content and hierarchy of a page when semantic tags are used, potentially improving search rankings.\n",
    "   - **Styling and Layout:** Semantic tags provide hooks for more precise styling and layout, allowing developers to create consistent and visually appealing designs.\n",
    "   - **Responsive Design:** When combined with CSS and JavaScript, semantic tags help in creating responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices."
